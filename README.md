# MY-SQL-DATABASE-GUVI
This Guvi Zen Class database model organizes user data, tracks code problem-solving achievements, records participation in company drives, monitors mentorship topics and tasks, maintains attendance, and logs user queries. Additionally, I honed my skills in designing an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram using MySQL Workbench, further solidifying my grasp of database design concepts.
